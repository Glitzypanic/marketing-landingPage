## Technologies Used 👨🏻‍💻

In this project, I have implemented the following technologies:

- React for building the user interface
- Vite as a development and build tool
- SWC for fast JavaScript transpilation
- ESLint for static code analysis
- pnpm for package management
- CSS for styling components

This combination has allowed me to develop a modern and efficient web application, leveraging the benefits of each tool to optimize both the development process and the final performance of the project.
